### Princlples used in this project
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures. 
- Single Responsibility Princple
  - states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. 
- Separation of Concerns
  - design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. 
- Minimize Coupling
  - Prevent the amount of dependencies on a module of code.
- Maximize Cohesion
  -  Code that has similar functionality should be found within the same component.
- Embrace Change
  - Software Development is always changing and growing so keep up or be left behind.

### paradigms used
A programming paradigm is a style or “way” of programming. Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others. 
- Functional 
  -  a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
- Object-Oriented
  - based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
